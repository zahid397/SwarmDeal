# SwarmDeal 🛒

**AI-Augmented Group Buying Assistant (Live Demo)**  
Built for Agentic Commerce on Arc Hackathon (Jan 2026)

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://5d9d82d7.swarmdeal.pages.dev/

SwarmDeal is an AI shopping assistant demo that explores the idea of
**group buying via conversational interaction**.  
Users describe what they want to buy, and the agent responds with
deal-oriented guidance based on user input and inferred group value.

This demo highlights user experience and product concept—
not a full payment/escrow backend yet.

## Architecture & Future Work

While this demo version runs entirely in the browser,
the full planned architecture envisions:

- AI reasoning with Gemini or similar API  
- Dynamic group matching and pricing logic  
- USDC micropayment flows via Circle Programmable Wallets  
- Arc testnet settlement and verification

## Why SwarmDeal Matters

SwarmDeal presents a prototype for how **agentic commerce interfaces**
could work:  
simple conversation → clear product intent → value-driven deal insights.

It’s not just a static UI—it’s a conceptual step toward *AI-mediated collective value*.
