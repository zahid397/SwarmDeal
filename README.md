Built for **Agentic Commerce**  
Hackathon Submission – GTM Hackathon 2026

🔗 **Live Demo:**

## Overview

SwarmDeal is an AI-augmented shopping assistant that explores the concept of
**group buying through conversational interaction**.

Users describe what they want to buy in natural language, and the system
responds with **deal-oriented guidance** based on inferred intent, group value,
and enrichment-driven insights.

This submission focuses on **product concept, UX, and agentic flow design**.

---

## Key Features

- Natural-language product request interface  
- Conversational AI-style chat UI  
- Group buying concept visualization  
- Deal-oriented recommendations demonstrating collective value  
- Clean, responsive frontend demo  
- No login required

---

## FullEnrich API Integration (Demo / Simulated)

This project is **designed to use the FullEnrich API** as its primary data
enrichment layer.

In the demo version, **FullEnrich-compatible enrichment flows are simulated**
to demonstrate how enriched firmographic and intent data would power:

- Buyer and company enrichment  
- Smarter group matching  
- Intent-based deal prioritization  
- Higher-confidence purchasing signals

In a production implementation, SwarmDeal would directly consume the
**FullEnrich API** for real-time enrichment of buyer and company data.

---

## Demo Scope

This hackathon submission intentionally focuses on:

- Agentic interaction flow
- Enrichment-driven decision logic (conceptual)
- UI/UX for conversational commerce

Blockchain settlement, payments, and live API calls are **out of scope** for
this demo and represented conceptually.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript  
- **Hosting:** Cloudflare Pages / Netlify  
- **Data Enrichment:** FullEnrich API (simulated in demo)  
- **Architecture:** Client-side demo with planned backend integration

---

## Architecture & Future Work

Planned production architecture includes:

- Live FullEnrich API integration for buyer/company enrichment  
- Advanced intent scoring and group formation logic  
- Payment flows (e.g., USDC via programmable wallets)  
- On-chain or off-chain settlement verification  
- Scalable agent orchestration layer

---

## Why SwarmDeal Matters

SwarmDeal demonstrates how **agentic commerce** can transform buying behavior:

**Conversation → Enriched intent → Collective value → Better deals**

Rather than static e-commerce flows, this project explores
AI-mediated collaboration and value discovery.
